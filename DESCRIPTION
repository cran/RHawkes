Description: The renewal Hawkes (RHawkes) process (Wheatley,
    Filimonov, and Sornette, 2016 <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2015.08.007>) is
    an extension to the classical Hawkes self-exciting point process
    widely used in the modelling of clustered event sequence data.
    This package provides functions to simulate the RHawkes process
    with a given immigrant hazard rate function and offspring birth
    time density function, to compute the exact likelihood of a
    RHawkes process using the recursive algorithm proposed by Chen and
    Stindl (2018) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1341324>, to compute the
    Rosenblatt residuals for goodness-of-fit assessment, and to
    predict future event times based on observed event times up to a
    given time. A function implementing the linear time RHawkes
    process likelihood approximation algorithm proposed in Stindl and
    Chen (2021) <doi:10.1007/s11222-021-10002-0> is also included.
